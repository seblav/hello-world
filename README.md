Hello world!

My name is SÃ©bastien, I am a Ph.D. Candiate in Astronomy at the University of Victoria seeking to move to full time employment. I am always looking for new challenges and can learn and adapt quickly. Thanks to my background in Physics and my years as a graduate student, I have strong problem solving and analytical skills. My graduate work involved researching new ways to understand data produced by a new type of astronomical instrument as well as analyzing diverse and complex data sets to find new scientifically relevant information. As a result, I have developed a refined skill set that, coupled to my Physics and Mathematics abilities, is well suited for positions outside astronomy involving data analysis and programming.

Throughout my time in academia, I have become very skilled at communicating complex ideas to individuals, experts and non-experts. On top of my lab teaching experience, I have given tens of astronomy-related presentations to the non-scientific community as well as professional talks at national and international astronomical conferences and workshops. I have also been involved for many years with student organizations and unions. In that time, I have learned how to manage projects and people as well as small budgets and deal with large administrations. Additionally, I am fluent in both English and French.
